This background used https://github.com/rocksdanister/audio-visualizer-wallpaper as a base.

Lively Wallpaper can be found both on the Microsoft Store and open source on Github (https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively/).

Just drag the folder holding the index.html into your Lively wallpapers forlder (...\Lively Wallpaper\Library\wallpapers). It should appear in your wallpaper library thereafter.

The html/css/js version, that can be used on a website, is located in the "docs" folder. This version is aimed towards Franco-Cit√©'s sites (like La Plume Verte), so I'll try to figure out how to make it simple for Wix (if I have time). Note that the code is currently broken.

The website version can be previewed here: https://101010101010101011010.github.io/LogoFCLivelyWallpaper/
